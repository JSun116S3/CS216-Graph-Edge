# CS216-Graph-Edge
This project is from CS 216 with Dr. Pike. The goal is to demonstrate a word ladder puzzle for a small group of four-letter words only. For example, let us
solve the “ladder” from the word “FOOL” to the word “SAGE”, and remember we only have a small set of four-letter words available. The relationships between the words as a graph: each four-letter word
represents a Vertex in the Graph; there is an edge from one word to another if the two words are only different by a single letter and use the graph algorithm named Breadth First Search (BFS) to find a shortest path from
the starting word to the ending word.
